hash_map_oa:
An implementation of an optimized HashMap class of open addressing with quadratic probing capabilities.
Includes methods to insert a key and value pair into the Hashmap or remove them,
resize or clear the map, and search for keys. Other methods have capabilities to return the load factor,
the amount of empty buckets, and an array with the keys and values. Final dunder functions
add iteration to the class.

hash_map_sc:
An implementation of an optimized HashMap class with chaining for collision resolution.
Includes methods to insert a key and value pair into the Hashmap or remove them, resize or
clear the map, and search for keys. Other methods have  capabilities to return the load factor,
the amount of empty buckets, and an array with the  keys and values.
 A final function returns the mode of a Dynamic Array using a HashMap.
